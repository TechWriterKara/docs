New users or those just beginning to test will find this 'Getting Started' tuturial very useful. We cover a few principal steps, basic concepts, and operations in Katalon Studio. You will learn how to create, verify, and debug projects and tests, as well as successfully plan and execute test cases.

Before You Begin
-----

Katalon Studio is simple and easy to use, even for users without much programming and scripting experience. If you are new to Katalon Studio but have some basic Java and/or Groovy skills and a brief understanding of testing, then you should have no problem making use of this tool.

- First, verify if your computer meets the [System Requirements](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/system-requirements.html) of Katalon Studio.
- For more info on how to install and set up Katalon Studio, check it out [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/tutorials/install_setup_katalon_studio.html) .

Get Ready!
-----

**Step 1: Set up a project**

In Katalon Studio, you can create a new project from scratch or from one of the [sample projects](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples) provided. Go to **File > New > Project** and select your preference. Then, enter the name of your new project and the location to store the project data.

_NOTE_: All Katalon Studio codes in this tutorial are included in the Getting Started Sample, which you can use as a reference.

**Step 2: Create the first test case**

Right-click on **Test Cases > New > Test Case**.

Test cases in Katalon Studio can be written in pure Selenium format:

```
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
String baseUrl = "https://www.katalon.com/";
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
driver.get("https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com");
driver.findElement(By.id("btn-make-appointment")).click();
driver.findElement(By.id("txt-username")).clear();
driver.findElement(By.id("txt-username")).sendKeys("John Doe");
driver.findElement(By.id("txt-password")).clear();
driver.findElement(By.id("txt-password")).sendKeys("ThisIsNotAPassword");
driver.findElement(By.id("btn-login")).click();
driver.quit();
```

Click **Run** to see how it works.

Writing test cases, especially high volume at once, can be time-consuming. If Selenium is not your preference, you can use Katalon Studio's standard format. The above test case would appear as below:

```groovy
WebUI.openBrowser('https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/')
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/a_Make Appointment'))
WebUI.setText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_Username_username'), 'John Doe')
WebUI.setEncryptedText(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/input_Password_password'), 'g3/DOGG74jC3Flrr3yH+3D/yKbOqqUNM')
WebUI.click(findTestObject('Page_CURA Healthcare Service/button_Login'))
```

Click **Run** to see how it works.

Katalon Studio's beginning steps are relatively self-explanatory; however, you may be questioning where “ChromeDriver” is located, what are “click” and “findTestObject” methods, or how to use the “Page_CURA Healthcare Service/a_Make Appointment” argument. Let’s go through them together.

In Katalon Studio, Browser drivers such as ChromeDriver are abstracted away from the code and set up at the execution time to make the code cross-browser enabled.

“Click” and “setText” are Katalon Studio’s [open-source built-in keywords](https://github.com/katalon-studio/katalon-studio-testing-framework) that wrap and enhance the limited set of Selenium keywords. You can also define your own set of [custom keywords](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/tutorials/create_custom_keyword.html) or import the shared custom keywords made by other Katalon Studio users.

“Page_CURA Healthcare Service/a_Make Appointment” is a [test object](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/manage-test-object.html) in Katalon Studio designed to follow the Page Object Model pattern. It helps centralize the application elements for easier scripting and maintenance. Additionally, Katalon Studio has recently developed ‘auto-healing’ (a feature that makes test objects sustainable, despite the continuously changing nature of the AUT).

Ultimately, the above script and objects can be quickly generated by the [‘Recording’](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/record-web-utility.html) and [‘Spying’](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/spy-web-utility.html) features.

You can also use Katalon Studio to perform manual testing. The tool uniquely provides a dual-script interface for both manual and automated tests:

 ![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/1.png)

To put into practice, here's how a team of testers and developers can apply these steps to a complete workflow: 

The automation experts prepare all the scripting work such as custom keywords, [test listeners](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-listeners-test-hooks.html), [calling test cases](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/call-test-case.html#call-test-case-in-manual-view), etc. Then the manual QAs,  unfamiliar with scripting, can utilize all the prepared materials to build test cases. Eventually, the manual QAs gradually learn how to script and become automation scripters.

**Step 3: Test Case Verification**

Let’s add verification script to the test case to know whether the login process is successful or not.

We have known how to use the basics of Katalon Studio scripts from the first test case. Now, let’s move further to create a more realistic test case with the **“Make Appointment”** header verification.

Katalon Studio provides a rich set of verification keywords to easily deal with that requirement. Once again, this kind of script can be done in both Manual or Script mode.

 ![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/2.png)

 ```groovy
- WebUI.verifyElementText(findTestObject('Object Repository/Page_CURA Healthcare Service/h2_Make Appointment'), 'Make Appointment', FailureHandling.STOP_ON_FAILURE)
```

After that, the execution results can be checked in the [Log Viewer](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/tutorials/viewing_execution_logs.html). To learn how to view execution logs, visit this [doc](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/tutorials/viewing_execution_logs.html).

**Step 4: Test Case Debugging**

Now we're going to intentionally make the test case fail by changing the verification text to **“Make another Appointment.”** In Katalon Studio, there are several ways to check for failure reasons.

**Option 1: Investigating Error Logs**

 ![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/4.png)

**Option 2: Debugging Mode**

To investigate complex scenarios, Katalon Studio provides a debug mechanism which works the same as the code debug mechanism in advanced developer IDE.

![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/5.png)

**Option 3: Manual Debug**

The **Recording** feature of Katalon Studio has its own method to debug as well. You can continue to record the failed test case, run the error test step, then investigate and fix the issue directly in the recording mode. See the examples below:

 ![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/8.png)

**Step 5: Plan the test case in a test suite**

Right-click on **Test Suites > New > Test Suite**

[A test suite](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/design-a-test-suite.html) is used to plan test cases with several configurations such as: retrying after failure, email sending, or data-driven binding. You can manage additional configurations for test suite execution by expanding the **Execution Information** section, as below:
![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/image2017-2-15-143A493A29.png)
![](../../images/katalon-studio/tutorials/introduction-to-web-testing/9.png)

For more details, visit [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/design-a-test-suite.html).

**Step 6: Execute the test suite and view the result**

Select the **Test Suite > Click Run**

The final step is executing the test cases in the designed test suite. Here's how to execute a test case: Once planned, the test suites or test suite collections can be executed not only directly in Katalon Studio, but also by [command line](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/tutorials/generate_command_line.html). Together with the standard JUnit format of the execution results and [pre-built Docker images](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docker-images), these features will give you full flexibility to integrate Katalon Studio into a CI/CD pipeline with tools such as Jenkins or CircleCI.
